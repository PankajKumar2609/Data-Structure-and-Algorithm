## Breadth First Search

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

#### Applications:
- Finding shortest path in unweighted network with least number of edges,
- In peer-to-peer network,
- In social networking website, many more.


#### Two main components of BFS are:
- Node/ Vertex
- Edges/ relations

#### Example:<br />
In social networking, each person is represented by node and are connected by edges with each other. Nodes are used to store all information of a person like name, mail-id, phone number, etc. And Edge represents connections between two persons and can be directed or un-directed.
