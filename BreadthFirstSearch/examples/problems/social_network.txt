In a social networking site, people are connected with other people. The whole system appears as a giant connected graph. In this question, you are required to <br /> answer the total number of people connected at t nodes away from each other (t distance connectivity). For example: Two persons directly connected are at 1 <br /> distance connectivity. While the two persons having a common contact without having direct connectivity, are at 2 distance connectivity.

First line of input line contains, two integers n and e, where n is the nodes and e are the edges. Next e line will contain two integers u and v meaning that node  <br /> u and node v are connected to each other in undirected fashion. Next line contains single integer, m, which is number of queries. Next m lines, each have  <br /> two inputs, one as source node and other as a required t distance connectivity which should be used to process query.

 

Note: The index of nodes will be 0-based. The example and the test case shown is of 1-based index. For submitting the solution, use 0-based indexing.

Explanation
After creating the graph, there was 3 queries,

Source node: 4, and we have to find out total number of nodes at a distance of 2 from node 4.
1(4->2->1), 8(4->7->8), 9(4->7->9), 6(4->7->6) = 4

Similarly as above
Source node: 2, and we have to find out total number of nodes at a distance of 1 from node 2.
1(2->1), 4(2->4), 3(2->3) = 3
